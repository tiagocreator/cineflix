## Cineflix

### [Live Preview](https://cineflix-ten.vercel.app/)

#### Cineflix is a movie and series database platform that has the look and style inspired by Netflix. It uses The Movie DB API to display movies and show details like genre and description.
 
I created this project in order to learn how to structure a beginner level React project.

The project has authentication using Google Firebase, the full style done in TalwindCSS and the function to save the movie to favorites, the movie data is updated every week.
